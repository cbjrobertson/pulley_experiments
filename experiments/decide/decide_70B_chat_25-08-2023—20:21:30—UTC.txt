The effort is applied at the point where the rope attaches to the pulley wheel, and the load is applied at the point where the rope attaches to the object being lifted.\n\nTo determine the mechanical advantage of the system, we need to calculate the distance from the fulcrum to the point where the effort is applied, and the distance from the fulcrum to the point where the load is applied.\n\nFrom the diagram, we can see that the distance from the fulcrum to the point where the effort is applied is 0.6 meters (since the radius of the pulley wheel is 0.6 meters).

In this case, the input force is the force applied to the pulley at the bottom (which is labeled as \"Strichmaxerl\"), and the output force is the force applied to the two pulleys at the top.\n\nTo calculate the mechanical advantage, we can analyze the forces acting on the pulleys. Let's call the input force F_in and the force applied to each pulley at the top F_out. The mechanical advantage M is defined as:\n\nM = F_out / F_in\n\nIn this system, we have two pulleys at the top, each with a radius of 0.5. Let's call the distance between the two pulleys D = 3.5 - 1 = 2.5. The angle between the two pulleys is 90 degrees, since they are aligned in opposite directions.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, we can calculate the length of the rope that connects the two pulleys:\n\na = D \\* sin(90) = D = 2.5\n\nNow, let's calculate the force applied to each pulley at the top. The force applied to the pulley on the left is:\n\nF_out_left = F_in \\* sin(90) = F_in \\* 1 = F_in\n\nThe force applied to the pulley on the right is:\n\nF_out_right = F_in \\* sin(90) = F_in \\* 1 = F_in\n\nSince the pulleys are identical, we can assume that the force applied to each pulley is equal. Therefore, the total force applied to the two pulleys is:\n\nF_out = F_out_left + F_out_right = 2 \\* F_in\n\nNow, we can calculate the mechanical advantage:\n\nM = F_out / F_in = 2\n\nTherefore, the mechanical advantage of the pulley system depicted in the TiKZ code is 2. This means that for every 1 unit of force applied to the input pulley, the system can generate 2 units of force at the output pulleys."

In this case, the input force is the force applied to the pulley at the top (F1), and the output force is the force applied to the pulley at the bottom (F2).\n\nTo find the mechanical advantage, we need to calculate the ratio of F2 to F1.\n\nIn this system, we can see that the pulley at the top has a radius of 0.5, and the pulley at the bottom has a radius of 0.6. The distance between the centers of the two pulleys is 2.25 - 0.9 = 1.35.\n\nUsing the formula for the mechanical advantage of a pulley system, we get:\n\nMechanical Advantage = (Radius of bottom pulley / Radius of top pulley) \\* (Distance between centers of pulleys / Radius of top pulley)\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\nMechanical Advantage = (0.6 / 0.5) \\* (1.35 / 0.5) = 2.7\n\nSo, the mechanical advantage of the pulley system depicted in the TiKZ code is 2.7.
