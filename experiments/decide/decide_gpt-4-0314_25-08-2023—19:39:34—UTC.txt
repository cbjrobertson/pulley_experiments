The code shows a system with three pulleys:\n\n1. A fixed pulley at the top left (coordinates: 0.6, 4)\n2. A movable pulley at the bottom (coordinates: 1.2, 1)\n3. A fixed pulley at the top right (coordinates: 2, 9)\n\nThe rope connections are as follows:\n\n- The rope starts from the person pulling (left side), goes over the top left fixed pulley, and then connects to the movable pulley at the bottom.\n- The rope then goes from the movable pulley at the bottom, over the top right fixed pulley, and finally connects to the load on the right side.\n\nThis pulley system is a combination of a first-class lever (fixed pulleys) and a second-class lever (movable pulley). The mechanical advantage of this system can be calculated by counting the number of rope segments that support the load.\n\nThere are two rope segments supporting the load in this system:\n\n1. The rope segment going from the movable pulley at the bottom to the top right fixed pulley.\n2. The rope segment going from the top right fixed pulley to the load.\n\nSo, the mechanical advantage of this pulley system is 2.
